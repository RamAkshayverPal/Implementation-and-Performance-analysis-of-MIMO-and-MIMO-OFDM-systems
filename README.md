# Implementation and Performance analysis of MIMO and MIMO-OFDM systems
I have implemented LMMSE, ZF and ML equalizing techniques to analyze the performances of MIMO receiver.\
MIMO Capacity optimization using svd and waterfilling algoritm is implemented.\
I have implemented MIMO-OFDM system to analyze the BER with different SNR.
